                <h1>PressReader for Fashion Week<br></h1>
                <h3>During Fall Fashion Week when all fashion lovers all came together, PressReader’s marketing team saw a great opportunity and partnered with publishers Hearst, Mondadori and Condé Nast on a marketing campaign that offered one week of free access to the best Italian publications including Vogue, Elle, Grazia, Marie Claire, Vanity City, and Flair, along with over 6,000 other publications available on the platform.</h3>

                <h2>Social Media Campaign</h2>
                <p>While the campaign was extensive and involved with several designers to work together, my main role was to implement eye-catching ads to attract frequent users on online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. As the target audience were enthusiasts who paid attention on the trend of fashion, I chose vivid colours and strong images to emphasize the chic and stylish appeal.</p>

                <p>​The image below features a lady wearing a pair of designer glasses. The reflection on the glasses shows what she is reading/looking at - the magazines that PressReader offers.</p>

                <p>​​Whereas this ad has bold colours that align with the tone of the images, The geometric overlay adds more definition and a sense of edginess to the overall layout.</p>

              <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p>​​To make the graphics more eye-catching, gif versions were also created since motion makes the content more dynamic and to grab attention easier. </p>

              <div class="col-lg-12">

                <p>​​​The graphics were showcased in various online platforms. The campaign has received <strong>54,000</strong> impressions on Instagram alone and over <strong>2,500</strong> tweet engagements.  </p>

              <h2>Case study report</h2>
              <p>​Together the entire campaign has obtained <strong>1.3 million</strong> impression across digital platform and social media. After gaining such positive result from the promotion, I was assigned to design a case study report, which collected all successful examples of the campaign. The report would be delivered as a marking piece to potential publishers, as an opportunity for them to marketing their publications with PressReader.</p>

                        <div class="placeholder"></div>

              <p>​While the design for social media images could be wild and abstract, the report needed to maintain the brand identity as the piece was handled as the company's voice. Therefore, the brand standard was followed, such as the colour green, the typeface and the iconic bubble tail for the header.</p>

              <p>​However, to incorporate with images and significant amount of texts, I decided to use the 3-column grid in order to leave some white space for the images, making balance between the texts and visual elements. Also, placing texts in column did not only make breaks between the paragraphs, but also mimics the layout of the magazine spreads. </p>

              <p>​For statistics, infographics would be a better and easier way to illustrate.</p>
